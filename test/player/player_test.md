# Player Unit Tests

## Testing Strategy

The test suite follows a user story-driven approach. 
Tests are organized by user stories with clear acceptance criteria, ensuring all game mechanics are properly validated. 
The suite includes 64 tests across 10 separate test files covering 9 user stories and additional file for implementation level testing.

## Test Structure
- **Main Test Runner**: `test/player/test_player.py` (imports and runs all tests)
- **User Story Files**: Individual test files for each user story (9 files)
- **Implementation Tests**: `test/player/test_player_implementation.py` (facade and implementation coverage)
- **Total Tests**: 64 test cases across 10 separate test files

## Running Tests

### Run All Unit Tests
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
. venv/Scripts/activate

# Run all player tests
python -m pytest test/player/test_player.py -v

# Run all tests in player directory
python -m pytest test/player/ -v
```

### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Run specific user story tests
python -m pytest test/player/test_combining_items.py -v
python -m pytest test/player/test_totem_tracking.py -v
python -m pytest test/player/test_attack_power_calculation.py -v
python -m pytest test/player/test_player_position_tracking.py -v
python -m pytest test/player/test_player_inventory_limit.py -v
python -m pytest test/player/test_health_property.py -v
python -m pytest test/player/test_attack_property.py -v
python -m pytest test/player/test_using_items.py -v
python -m pytest test/player/test_dropping_items.py -v

# Run implementation tests
python -m pytest test/player/test_player_implementation.py -v
```

## Generate Coverage Reports

### Coverage for All Player Tests
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
python -m pytest test/player/ --cov=src.model.player --cov-report=html

# View coverage report
# Open htmlcov/index.html in browser
```

### Coverage for Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Run specific test suite with coverage
python -m pytest test/player/test_player.py --cov=src.model.player --cov-report=html

# Run user story test with coverage
python -m pytest test/player/test_combining_items.py --cov=src.model.player --cov-report=html
```

## Tutor Given Test Cases

```bash
# Weapon Equip Effect
# Given the player equips a weapon, When the player fights zombies, Then the weapon bonus is applied.
# Test: Test_PlayerImplementation.test_use_item_weapon_type in test_player_implementation.py
# Coverage: Verifies weapon items return attack bonus when used (base attack + weapon bonus)
python -m pytest test/player/test_player_implementation.py::Test_PlayerImplementation::test_use_item_weapon_type -v

# Combat with Gasoline and Candle
# Given the player equips Gasoline and Candle, When fighting zombies using Gasoline and Candle,
# Then all zombies on the tile are killed, And Gasoline is removed from inventory, and player health is unaffected.
# Test: Test_PlayerImplementation.test_combat_with_gasoline_and_candle in test_player_implementation.py
# Coverage: Verifies gasoline is removed (uses_remaining=0), candle remains in inventory, and player health is unaffected
python -m pytest test/player/test_player_implementation.py::Test_PlayerImplementation::test_combat_with_gasoline_and_candle -v
```
